# Sanity Check

Review the current diff and provide a concise report highlighting only â€˜Issuesâ€™ and â€˜Quick Fixesâ€™, without additional commentary.

Focus:

- security, breaking changes
- logic errors, performance
- code quality, maintainability
- unrelated edits

Style: ultra-concise bullets, priority order, actionable only.

## Execute commands:

1. `git diff HEAD`
2. `git status --porcelain`

## Report issues and quick fixes:

ðŸš¨ Issues
â€¢ brief description

ðŸ’¡ Quick Fixes
