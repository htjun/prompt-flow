# Only Necessary Comments

Comment only when needed for understanding:

- Complex business logic
- Non-obvious edge cases
- Why (not what) something was done
- External API quirks
- Performance considerations

Don't comment obvious code or restate what code does.

Be concise. Explain "why", not "what".
