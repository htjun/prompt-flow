# Git Commit Summary

Generate a concise, conventional commit message based on the current git changes.

Follow this format:

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep description under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- No period at the end
- Focus on WHAT changed, not WHY

Examples:

- `feat(auth): add user login validation`
- `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation steps`
- `refactor(store): simplify state management`

First analyze the git diff, then provide ONLY the commit message as a single line.
